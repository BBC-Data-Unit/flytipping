In September 2016 it was [reported](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37350153) that fly-tipping across England was getting worse with councils spending more than Â£67m to clean up public land and prosecute anyone they catch. The reports complemented a [report by the TV programme Inside Out](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07v70n7).
